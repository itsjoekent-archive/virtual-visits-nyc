**How to log your calls**

We recommend you call each person you are matched with once or twice a week. Please use [this form](https://airtable.com/shrPJHVQh6RTfVvtQ) to log every call you make, even if you do not connect. If you do connect, try to record an answer to every question if you can. 

**Resend match information**

If you lose track of the contact information for the older adults you are calling, fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shr6twCHc4bPxDsy4) and it will get resent to you.

**Request new matches**

You can request new matches if you do not reach some or all of the people you were assigned to call, or you do reach them, but they do not want to receive ongoing calls. You can also request new matches if you are already making regular calls and want to take on more! 

To do so, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrAxGfOJ3NAsZAdK). 

**How to notify us if you want to stop making calls**

If you want to stop calling one or all of your matches, we understand! Just let us know using [this form](https://airtable.com/shrrUh72b1Lx9bk23).

**Contact us**
