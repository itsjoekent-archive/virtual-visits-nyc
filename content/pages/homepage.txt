Help call seniors during the COVID-19 crisis

@homepageSubtitle
The Neighbor Network matches volunteers with seniors to call in New York City during the COVID-19 crisis.

These regular calls help to fight social isolation, connect older New Yorkers with the resources they need, and build relationships that will bring joy and comfort to seniors and volunteers alike.

In times of crisis, New Yorkers look out for each other. As coronavirus keeps older adults home-bound for months on end, regular calls through the neighbor network help to connect people to support, to prevent social isolation from gnawing deeper, to build relationships that sustain us through this challenging time, and to bring a little joy into lonely days on both sides of the phone line.
