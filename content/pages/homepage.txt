Help call seniors during the COVID-19 crisis

@homepageSubtitle
The Neighbor Network matches volunteers with seniors to call in New York City during the COVID-19 crisis.

These regular calls help to fight social isolation, connect older New Yorkers with the resources they need, and build relationships that will bring joy and comfort to seniors and volunteers alike.
