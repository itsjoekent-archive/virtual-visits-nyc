Greenwich House Volunteer Information 

@pageContent

Note: please only use the resources on this page if you attended a training on making calls to older adults in Lower Manhattan with Greenwich House.

**Initial calls**

The initial calls link is emailed to volunteers immediately following their training. If you cannot locate the link, email us at greenwichhouse@theneighbornetwork.org. Use this link to call seniors until you match with 1-3 people who want to continue receiving calls. 

**How to log your recurring calls**

We recommend you call each person you are matched with once or twice a week. Please use [this form](https://airtable.com/shrMSplh6yLp9TKNU) to log every call you make, even if you do not connect. If you do connect, try to record an answer to every question if you can. 

**Request a screened match**

If you prefer not to connect with a senior by making calls through the phone bank, but you still want match(es) to call weekly, please fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shr5etpvZS0D5UifV) to request a screened match. These matches are seniors who confirmed they want initial calls, and were previously contacted by a volunteer. We will match you as soon as possible but cannot guarantee when.  

**Resend match information**

If you lose track of the contact information for the older adults you are calling, fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrLGPTQ7LH8ebAnX) and it will get resent to you.

**Volunteer guide**

If you have any questions about our system, check out the [volunteer guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhHs96g_Py-fM-qweagoCdqsyL-41A99u9Eih9ZhHh4/edit?usp=sharing), which covers both initial and recurring calls, as well as FAQ. 

**How to notify us if you want to stop making calls**

If you want to stop calling one or all of your matches, we understand! Just let us know using [this form](https://airtable.com/shr0WuDOdiProo3JM).

**Contact us**

If you have any questions, email us at greenwichhouse@theneighbornetwork.org or call and leave a voicemail at (914) 573-5526â€¬. 

Thanks so much for volunteering!
