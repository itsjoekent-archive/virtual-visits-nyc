**How to log your calls**

We recommend you call each person you are matched with once or twice a week. Please use [this form](https://airtable.com/shrMSplh6yLp9TKNU) to log every call you make, even if you do not connect. If you do connect, try to record an answer to every question if you can. 

**Resend match information**

If you lose track of the contact information for the older adults you are calling, fill out [this form](https://airtable.com/shrLGPTQ7LH8ebAnX) and it will get resent to you.

**How to notify us if you want to stop making calls**
