## For Seniors

If you are 60 or older and live in New York City, [sign up here to receive calls!](https://1b8qv11cqpx.typeform.com/to/xzcsnwfH) You can also sign someone else up as long as they agree to be in the program. If you prefer to enroll over the phone, call us at (914) 573-5526 and leave a voicemail; we’ll call you back to conduct intake over the phone.

If you sign up, we will get you matched with a trained volunteer as soon as you can. The volunteer will call you once a week or so (you can indicate your preference when you sign up) just to chat and get to know each other. If you have any questions about what it means to sign up, email greenwichhouse@theneighbornetwork.org or call us at (914) 573-5526 and leave a voicemail. We’ll call you back to answer your questions. 

## For Volunteers

**Volunteers must complete a 1-hour zoom training to begin calls. Please note that we are currently in a transition period, and our available trainings may have reached their volunteer cap. We will still need lots of volunteers when we schedule new sessions in the coming weeks! Please fill out [this form to receive updates when we schedule more trainings.](https://airtable.com/shrncXiYr9NNaBMW5)** 

Click the links below to view the training schedule and sign up:

[Sign up for a phone banking event to reach isolated seniors (must be 16 or over to volunteer)](https://www.mobilize.us/neighbornetwork/?tag_ids=212). After the event, you will be able to continue phone banking on your own time. 

You can volunteer for any of our programs regardless of where you live. You don’t even have to live in New York City to help out!

**Can’t make any of the trainings linked above? Sign up [HERE](https://airtable.com/shrncXiYr9NNaBMW5) to receive updates when we schedule more sessions!** You will receive updates about when to sign up for the following programs: 
-Our program in collaboration with Greenwich House, to call seniors from around NYC who have signed up to receive friendly calls. 
-Our vaccine support program, to reach out to seniors with the goal of assisting them through the process of signing up for and receiving vaccines. 
-Our phone banking program, to make check-in "cold calls" to seniors to connect them to needed resources. 

...And more programs in the works! 

(Please note we are not currently accepting volunteers for the Heights and Hills/Brooklyn program.)
