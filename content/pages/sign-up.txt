Volunteers must complete a 1-hour zoom training to begin calls. Trainings are scheduled weekly at varying times.  

Neighbor Network currently operates in partnership with two social service organizations: Greenwich House and Heights and Hills. These two partnerships operate as separate programs. Click the links below to view the training schedule and sign up. If you do not see any trainings scheduled, that may mean that the trainings currently available have reached their signup cap. In that case, please fill out [this form to receive updates when we schedule more sessions.](https://airtable.com/shrncXiYr9NNaBMW5)

[Sign up to make friendly calls to seniors from around NYC with Greenwich House (must be 16 or over to volunteer)](https://www.mobilize.us/neighbornetwork/?tag_ids=730)

(Please note we are not currently accepting volunteers for the Heights and Hills/Brooklyn program.) 

**You can volunteer for either program regardless of where you live. You don’t even have to live in New York City to help out!**

We recommend that you sign up to make calls with just one of our partners. While the programs are very similar, they have been tailored to meet the needs of each organization, so there are some differences. 

**Can’t make any of the trainings linked above? Sign up [HERE](https://airtable.com/shrncXiYr9NNaBMW5) to receive updates when we schedule more sessions!** You will receive updates about when to sign up for the following programs: 
-Our program in collaboration with Greenwich House, to call seniors from around NYC who have signed up to receive friendly calls. 
-Our vaccine support program, to reach out to seniors with the goal of assisting them through the process of signing up for and receiving vaccines. 
-Our phone banking program, to make check-in "cold calls" to seniors to connect them to needed resources. 
...And more programs in the works! 

If you have any questions about these programs, email felicia@theneighbornetwork.org.
