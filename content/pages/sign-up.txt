Volunteers must complete a 1-hour zoom training to begin calls. Trainings are scheduled weekly at varying times.  

Neighbor Network currently operates in partnership with two social service organizations: Greenwich House (in Manhattan) and Heights and Hills (in Brooklyn). These two partnerships operate as separate programs. Click the links below to view the training schedule and sign up:

[Sign up to call older adults in the West Village with Greenwich House (must be 15 or over to volunteer)](https://www.mobilize.us/neighbornetwork/?tag_ids=730)

(Please note we are not currently accepting volunteers for the Heights and Hills/Brooklyn program.) 

**You can volunteer for either program regardless of where you live. You don’t even have to live in New York City to help out!**

We recommend that you sign up to make calls with just one of our partners. While the programs are very similar, they have been tailored to meet the needs of each organization, so there are some differences. 

**Can’t make any of the trainings linked above? Sign up [HERE](https://airtable.com/shrncXiYr9NNaBMW5) to receive updates when we schedule more sessions!**
