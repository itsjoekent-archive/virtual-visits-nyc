Neighbor Network currently operates in partnership with two social service organizations: Greenwich House (in Manhattan) and Heights and Hills (in Brooklyn). These two partnerships operate as separate programs. 

We recommend that you sign up to make calls with just one of our partners. While the programs are very similar, they have been tailored to meet the needs of each organization, so there are some differences. 

**You can volunteer for either program regardless of where you live. You don’t even have to live in New York City to help out!**
