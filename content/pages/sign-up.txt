## For Seniors

If you are 60 or older and live in New York City, [sign up here to receive calls!](https://1b8qv11cqpx.typeform.com/to/xzcsnwfH) You can also sign someone else up as long as they agree to be in the program. If you prefer to enroll over the phone, call us at (914) 573-5526 and leave a voicemail; we’ll call you back to conduct intake.

If you sign up, we will get you matched with a trained volunteer as soon as you can. The volunteer will call you once a week or so (you can indicate your preference when you sign up) just to chat and get to know each other. [You can find more information here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIQePyfg0ma6n1XLQUkz1Ow6TvMLYPLN/view?usp=sharing) If you have any questions about what it means to sign up, email greenwichhouse@theneighbornetwork.org or call us at (914) 573-5526 and leave a voicemail. We’ll call you back to answer your questions. 

## For Volunteers

Click the links below to view the training schedule and sign up:

[Sign up to make wellness calls to older adults in Queens with our partner Sunnyside Community Services (must be 18 or over to volunteer)](https://www.mobilize.us/neighbornetwork/event/378301/) You will be trained to make wellness calls to several seniors on a weekly basis. 

[Sign up to assist older New Yorkers with making and accessing vaccine appointments (must be 21 or over to volunteer)](https://www.mobilize.us/neighbornetwork/?tag_ids=2938).
