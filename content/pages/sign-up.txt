## For Older New Yorkers

**Vaccine Support**

Neighbor Network volunteers are making appointments, booking transportation, and otherwise supporting New Yorkers through the process of getting COVID vaccines. All assistance is provided over the phone. We are prioritizing individuals 60 and over, but will not turn anyone away. You can [sign up to receive this support by filling out this form](https://tinyurl.com/vaccinenavigation) or calling us at (646) 470-8259. You can also sign up someone you know. 

If you have any questions about this service, you can call us at (646) 470-8259 or email vaccine@theneighbornetwork.org. 

**Friendly Calls**

If you are 60 or older and live in New York City, [sign up here to receive friendly calls from a volunteer!](https://form.typeform.com/to/xzcsnwfH) You can also sign up by calling us at (914) 573-5526 and leaving a voicemail. We'll call you back to get you set up. 

If you sign up, we will get you matched with a trained volunteer as soon as we can. The volunteer will call you once a week or so (you can indicate your preference when you sign up) just to chat and get to know each other. [You can find more information here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LIQePyfg0ma6n1XLQUkz1Ow6TvMLYPLN/view?usp=sharing) If you have any questions about what it means to sign up, email greenwichhouse@theneighbornetwork.org or call us at (914) 573-5526 and leave a voicemail.

You can also sign someone else up as long as they agree to be in the program.
