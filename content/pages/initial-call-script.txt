Initial Call Script

@pageContent

NOTE: for more information, check out our [Volunteer How-to Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BhHs96g_Py-fM-qweagoCdqsyL-41A99u9Eih9ZhHh4/edit?usp=sharing). 

This is the script you will use when you make your first calls to seniors. The goals of these first calls are to check in with seniors, connect them to resources if they need them, and see if they want to receive ongoing calls (if they do, you'll keep calling them!). 

Instructions for callers are in brackets [like this]. Everything else you can say out loud. We'll give you more detailed information during training sessions. 

### Voicemail message:

Hello [NAME], this is [VOL NAME]. I’m a neighbor/community volunteer calling to check in during this time of crisis.
