## What is the Neighbor Network?

The Neighbor Network matches volunteers with seniors to call in New York City during the COVID-19 crisis. These regular calls help to fight social isolation, connect older New Yorkers with the resources they need, and build relationships that will bring joy and comfort to seniors and volunteers alike. The project is built on a partnership between Greenwich House, Heights & Hills, the New York Civic Engagement Table and the Office of NYC Council Member Brad Lander.

## Why is this important?

Social distancing is critical to keep our communities safe in the weeks to come. Because our homebound senior neighbors face a higher health risk, this likely means many more months of physical isolation and the challenges that come with it – difficulty accessing food, medicine and mental health services, a lack of reliable information, and separation from friends and family.

By volunteering to regularly make calls to seniors during this crisis, you can help connect your neighbors to the resources they need while building meaningful relationships.
